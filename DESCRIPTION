Description: Useful functions for wrangling data, training, and evaluating prediction models. Commonly used functions include the Brier Score, Scaled Brier Score, and a quick one-hot encoding utility. The package name is pronounced "g'mish", Yiddish for a collection of odds and ends. The name is inspired by Hmisc, but gmisc was already taken.
